    3. Delete a product, so that I can remove items from my store that are no longer available.
    4. Add a blog post, so that I can add new content to my blog page to help drive traffic to my store.
    5. Edit a blog post, so thas I can change the details of the blog such as its title, content, image and other properties. 
    6. Delete a blog post, so that I can remove blog posts that are outdated or irrelevent.
